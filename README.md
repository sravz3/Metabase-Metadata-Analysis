# Metabase Metadata Analysis with Python
This repository showcases how to connect to Metabase API to analyse the its metadata. The main purpose of this repository is to help understand how one can fetch the necessary data from the available API endpoints. 
In this case, we fetch data from "card", "database" and "collections" endpoints to create a master data comprising of all the analysis created on the site along with the database and collection linked to it. 

## Usage

1. Download all the files.

2. Create an API key in Metabase. Follow instructions on https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/people-and-groups/api-keys.
  
3. Update the '<API_KEY>' with the one you previously created.

4. Update '<BASE_URL>' with your Organisation's Metabase URL.

6. Run the file and save your results.

7. Build further functions based on your requirements to slice and dice data in any way you want.
